## Hallo und herzlich willkommen! 

<img src="assets/images/griffin.jpg" alt="Sanitas with Friends" style="float: left; margin: 10px 5px 0px 0px; width: 339px;"> I’m Jasmine Garland, a PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I study climate resilience and energy systems in the [GRIFFIN Lab](http://www.kyrib.com) (pictured to the left) and the [Water and Climate Research Group](https://ciresgroups.colorado.edu/livneh/welcome). This blog is a space to share my thoughts, reflections, and experiences as I prepare for an exciting academic chapter: relocating and conducting research at ETH Zürich in Switzerland.

I’m honored to be supported by the [Temple Hoyne Buell Endowed Ambassadorial Scholarship](https://rotary5450.org/sitepage/temple-buell-scholarship), a program of **Rotary District 5450** that supports international research and cultural exchange for graduate students along Colorado’s Front Range. As a recipient, I have the opportunity to represent CU Boulder abroad, collaborate with leading researchers, and expand the reach of my work on climate resilience and energy systems. Through this experience, I hope to embody Rotary's mission of fostering global understanding and service. 

At ETH Zürich, I’ll be conducting research in [Professor Gabriela Hug’s](https://psl.ee.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.OTE2MDE=.TGlzdC8yNTEyLC0xNTM3NjU3MDcy.html) Power Systems and High Voltage Lab, which specializes in advanced methods for power system control, renewable energy integration, and the future of electric grid operation. This collaboration is a natural extension of my own work on climate-driven grid disruptions and low-carbon infrastructure planning. I’m also excited to engage with the broader research community through the [Energy Science Center](https://esc.ethz.ch/), a vibrant interdisciplinary hub at ETH focused on addressing complex energy challenges from both technical and societal perspectives.

Before diving into research at ETH Zürich, I’m taking a few weeks to travel through Europe, an opportunity to move slowly, soak in new surroundings, and arrive in Switzerland with a clear mind and fresh perspective. Rather than a whirlwind sightseeing tour, this time is about intentional exploration. I’ll be weaving between vibrant cities and quiet mountain villages (ein bisschen Stadt, ein bisschen Berg), reconnecting with friends along the way, learning as I go, following curiosity, and — _as always_ — running through the landscapes that inspire me.

### Why This Blog?

Think of this blog as part Reisetagebuch, part research journal -a space to reflect on more than just the work, but on what it means to live, grow, and run freely across landscapes and lines on a map.

**Document the Experience**: I’ll share what it’s like to live, research, and adapt abroad, from navigating logistics to finding rhythm in a new academic culture and city life in Zürich.

**Reflect on Research**: I’ll explore technical and policy challenges central to my work, including how we build electric grids that are both resilient to climate stress and socially equitable.

**Travel & Trail**: Outside the lab, I’m a passionate trail and ultra-runner. I plan to use my time in Europe not only for academic growth but also to explore the Alps—zu Fuß in the form of long solo mountain adventures and ultra-distance races. These experiences are a key part of how I recharge, reflect, and stay connected to the landscapes that fuel my work.

**Foster Connection**: Whether you’re a fellow researcher, student, or just someone who loves a good trail story, I hope this blog brings insight, curiosity, inspiration, or at least a reason to say, “Ach, wie schön!”

Though I’m currently based in Boulder, Colorado, this international experience marks a significant step in my academic and personal journey. I look forward to sharing what I learn from the technical to the trail and how this chapter helps shape the future of my research and worldview.


<img src="assets/images/sanita.jpg" alt="Sanitas with Friends" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px; width: 345px;"> Before heading to Europe, I’ve been savoring my final weeks in Boulder—spending time with friends, running familiar trails, and soaking in the landscapes that have shaped both my research and daily movement. One of my favorite send-off traditions was Everesting Mt. Sanitas for my birthday, climbing the equivalent of Mt. Everest (from sea-level) by repeating my favorite local summit. Several different friends joined throughout (Rona and Kendall are pictured to the right), making it full of sweat, gratitude, and reflection—a fitting way to mark both an ending and a beginning.
